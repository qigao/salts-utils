The selected upstream include and source files in this directory are
unmodified files from a snapshot produced with `git archive`; this
`UPSTREAM.md` records local provenance. `../../CMakeLists.txt` provides the
integration and limits the build to the WEI448 curve, SHAKE256 hash, and
EDDSA448 signature implementation.
