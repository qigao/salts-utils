# CFlowProcess

`Salts::Process` combines the existing Core process owner with the
CFlow native byte-pipe Actor. It is a separate target because Core already uses
CFlow internally; placing this adapter in CFlow would create a dependency cycle.

The adapter owns one `salts_process_t`, three parent-side asynchronous pipe
endpoints, one fixed-capacity native backend, one manual Executor, one IO Actor,
and exactly `request_capacity` operation slots. It never exposes raw endpoints,
captures output into an unbounded buffer, or creates a second process state
machine.

## API contract

`cflow_process_start(process, options, config)` borrows `options` and `config`
only for the call. It rejects Core capture/pipe flags because the adapter must
remain the only standard-stream consumer. `backend_kind`, `request_capacity`,
`command_capacity`, `completion_batch_capacity`, and `completion` are required;
unsupported native pipe backends return `SALTS_ENOTSUP` without fallback.

`try_write_stdin`, `try_read_stdout`, and `try_read_stderr` borrow each buffer
until its terminal callback returns. Accepted operations receive a nonzero
request ID and exactly one `OK`, `EOF`, `CANCELLED`, or `FAILED` completion.
Reads and writes may complete with fewer bytes than requested. Full request or
command capacity is returned as a typed submit/cancel result; storage never
grows after start.

`cflow_process_close_stdin()` returns `SALTS_EBUSY` while an admitted stdin
write remains live. After it succeeds, the child observes EOF and later stdin
submissions return `CLOSED`. `cflow_process_get_stats()` exposes the Actor's
bounded admission counters together with endpoint ownership and close state.

Submission and cancellation inherit the IO Actor's MPSC contract. Exactly one
driver calls `cflow_process_run_ready()`, and callbacks execute on that driver.
Stop and join producers before lifecycle calls. `close()` closes admission,
requests cancellation, and terminates a live child; continue driving until
`is_quiescent()`, then call `destroy()`. No endpoint is closed before its
authoritative operation completion has been delivered and acknowledged.
